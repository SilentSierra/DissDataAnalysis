Technically, a media will pass a test if there’s one interaction between two women drug addicts about drugging children, but it’s still a questionable message if that’s the only interaction women have ","Merlin BBC with Morgana - sure, she is evil, but her motivations are clearly defined and understandable, and she’s a decently well written as a character, but then the show has a whole of three statistically significant women. The Legend of Vox Machina - an animated series, women are portrayed in all ways, shapes, colours, alignments. Brooklyn 99 did a good job too. ","Latest Assassins Creed did decently - except they are cowards and have still not committed to having a woman protagonist, always having an option to change characters gender, so the toxic community doesn’t lash out about them being ‘woke’. Same problem with Cyberpunk 2077, but in reverse. The Last of Us 2 has amazing women characters though from what I’ve glimpsed. Technically tomb raider would fit the criteria - but the protagonist is so heavily sexualised that this technicality hurts. Hades was really good. ",Yes,,"A sense of drive, motivation, intelligence behind the choices - and the ability to make those choices. A strong female character can easily be a housewife - stereotypically weak position and all - but still be skilled in handling difficult situations, in keeping the balance, in being a moving force, if represented and written properly ","A stupid naiveness is a big no for me - a lot of ‘strong’ women characters fall into a ‘born sexy yesterday’ stereotypes and it drives me up the wall, because it’s all about a naive pretty women who live their life ‘wrong’ until a man shows up and show them what’s right ",Historical accuracy/context can never justify a lack of representation,"‘Historical context’ is a consequence of overlooking women in history, especially WW2 - the amount of women snipers?? Women sergeants?? If historical context was actually accurate, there would be women everywhere- discriminated against mostly, but still there. The AIDS crisis?? Women are everywhere, always been everywhere in history, and erasing them is not synonymous of accuracy ",Other (please clarify in Question 24 below),"In theory, yes, but I can hardly think of a good example? Tomb Raider surely isn’t, the entire video game is her backside in tight pants in front of a scenery. It is difficult to say how it can be done - even turning into a robot would not really stop the sexualisation, and it kind of didn’t, the Metroid Dread example still has extremely exaggerated female traits and accents on thighs, waist, and I’m sure there are boobs there somewhere. Actually, maybe one example of it would be Vi and Caitlyn from League of Legends and the way, way, *way* better representation of them in Arcane series. It is, however, overshadowed by a toxic community that decided to sexualise a teenager in that show instead, so you know, you win some you loose some. ","Motivations of individual characters and their role in the overall plot? Do they make a difference to the plot? Technically, the Lord of the Rings doesn’t pass the test, but Eowyn is probably one of the strongest characters in the entire trilogy, and her actions and her presence define the course of the narrative in parts. Katara from Avatar the Last Airbender is also one of the strongest characters ever probably, so is Toph, and they are central to the plot line. On the other hand, Phoebe from Friends is central in the series, but arguably strong as a character within a narrative, at least to me - besides her own story, she hardly impacts the lives for other friends, save for the time she let Rachel live at her place for a while. ","Appearance and clothing is usually key in highlighting elements about characters, and props that immediately surround them. Also things like accents, implying their origin and background. ","Again, their impact on the story - if there’s a story. A lot is down to the dialogue and random lines characters say in the meantime that are used to highlight their experiences. ","Appearance and clothing in default settings gives a good idea about how the characters are expected to be perceived- and the voice acting, though often underestimated, is incredibly influential. Roshan from (not even yet released) Assassins Creed Mirage has shook me to the core, there is a weight and gravitas and force to that voice, and from the trailer it seems to be very fitting to the leadership position she holds - I hope they don’t mess it up, honestly ","Equipment that is clearly male/female coded - we’re talking exclusively finding armoured bra’s if you’re playing a woman. The high-pitched moans of pain when hit - really messed up my Tomb Raider experience. It’s not gameplay probably though. The over the top pink abilities in League of Legends though is very gameplay choice - but then again, it’s a known toxic horrible game ","Relatability, I suppose. But also, since I prefer story-driven games, it’s always about their motivations and drive - I don’t really vibe with ‘saving the love interest’, but I’m very on board with mass murder for the greater good if she swings that way, you know.

It all depends",In video games narrative seems to be taking a back seat for exploration so it is harder to show any sort of representation except in things like side quests. In more narrative games it can be used like in movies but with the person in control empathy can be increased as their struggle was literally yours.,Character plays a stronger role as you are less likely to see growth in side character in a game over a movie so that base character you start with has to represent some group if you want it to. The main characters starting point is even more important as a good game is all about progress and growth.,Little. How a game plays does little to represent the character.,Not great but improving. I think in modern games a strong female character can be found in it but on the other hand the protagonist will rarely be (or become) said character. As mentioned above I do think horizon zero dawn does this well as it does mention how the female character has to act differently to their male counterparts. It shows her overcoming her struggles and eventually becoming great. I do think the whole prophesied one does undermine this but it does add to the story.

Amnesia Rebirth (2020) is a game where you play as a woman who is essentially stranded on her own and in that sense the story revolves around her alone, without the help of anyone else.  She acts believably and relatably and her identity as a woman is directly acknowledged within the story - her womanhood is essential to her as a character.  Milk Inside A Bag of Milk... & its sequel Milk Outside a Bag of Milk... are two indie visual novels in which the player must talk to a girl who is going to the store to buy milk.  The story tackles themes of isolation, mental illness and exclusion and is generally sad.

If your WW2 film is aiming to be a real representation of the front lines, where almost no women were; then the representation of women doesn't seem entirely relevant here.

Steven Moffat's Doctor Who, Dracula, Jekyll & Sherlock is a good example of poorly represented female characters despite things looking promising at first glance.  His narratives only need 3 types of woman: pathetic, in love with the main male character (even if she's a lesbian??), or very openly a dominatrix (but has a soft ""weak"" side, again, for the main male character only). ","It's hard for me to break this stuff down into components (sorry), especially because we'd be here forever because I believe the entire thing plays a part in this - representation is part of a huge tangled web we call a work of art; be it a movie or video game. ",Same answer as above," Again I believe every component and am struggling to compartmentalize everything, but gameplay gets overlooked often as a building block for a work of art! Often female characters will be weaker with less useful attacks, or just healers (which isn't bad in a vaccum, but it's certainly a pattern). Xenoblade Chronicles 3 comes to mind as a good example of representation through gameplay, as a male and female character in the main party represent each vague class (combat, tank, support). However Sena is a tank but she's built like a twig haha - all 3 girls are quite small and skinny. It can be explained away with magic, but that feels like a weak idea. I feel their bodies could have been more diverse but that's less to do with gameplay. The game overall is wonderfully diverse. "," I consume the media, check out what these characters do and how they act, and when it's poor representation, it's poor representation. I dont look out for anything in particular - usually when the writing is sexist, even when it's hidden under several layers of girlbossery, you can spot it."

Is the conversation about a man who is already important to the story, because something like “famous or in-universe fictional man we’re referencing for random convo” is a different. Plus it doesn’t feel quite enough. It’s better than the “sexy lamp test” as my animator brain can imagine a lamp doing literally anything.",Other (please clarify in Question 14 below),The protagonist could be female and would the same thing apply to the two female side characters? What if there’s a female side character and non-binary side character conversing? Can that lend towards as there’s no man?,Stranger Things’ Max and Eleven have non-man convos as adolescent girls,"Final Fantasy VII Remake w/ Aerith and Tifa having non-Cloud convos, Xenoblade Chronicles *3* (not 2) w/ Mio and Sena having non-Noah convos and grew up together before the main story.",Other (please clarify in Question 18 below),"“Strength” can mean physical, but to me, it’s endurance. Not how good a deal she can deal damage, but how well she can take damage. Jolyne Cujoh (JJBA Pt 6: Stone Ocean) stands out more than MCU’s Captain Marvel because she takes more visible damage just to get continue the struggle to get through, even if Jolyne can’t dish out more damage than Captain Marvel. Korra from The Legend of Korra is another good example, she is physically strong but it’s the losses is what makes her successes glow.","Enduring, clever, established meaningful flaws to overcome, can start off ”talented” but shows growth in what they need to.","Misandry/obsessive patriarchy hate, toxic masculine traits projected on a woman, fatale-but-nothing-else, flawless.",Historical accuracy/context can justify a lack of representation in some instances,"Depending on the seriousness of the material. In Call of Duty or Battlefield, it’s partially a power fantasy than a “horrors of war” kind of narrative, woman should be represented there. If the intent was to retell a soldier’s specific perspective, leaning into accuracy for recreation is more key.",Yes,"Samus had a bad wrap in Other M but there was potential I can see. Her having trauma surfacing was an excellent idea, but her needing orders to activate an ability isn’t what she’s about from previously established works. Also in Metroid Dread the reward is pretty artworks of previous games instead, so the “Samus strip%” is no more.","Activity of characters in plot, also not playing “the Planet of Hats” in worldbuilding. Themes are important in a message and the representation can contribute into it and not contradict it. (*cough* Persona contradictory homophobia *cough*)","representing traits of what makes a character interesting w/o leaning into stereotypes (specifically for race and LGBTQIA+), relationships of characters, platonic relationships between man and woman.","Same as movies and films, but at least bare minimum in active story minimum games like Metroid.","Same as film/movie. But also, varying body type designs can benefit gameplay in tandem, Chun-Li’s thick thighs aren’t just for show but they’re also indicating “watch out for kicks” or “utilize low attacks”. There was a good video by T B Skyen on Olympic women of various sports and how varied “strong women” builds can be depending on their accustomed talent, a javelin thrower and fencer both use arms but there’s still a clear distinction in their builds. This can apply to film too, assuming animated where designs are flexible.","Depends on the genre. If in the case of a class-based game or RPG, more than performers or healers for women. (If we’re discussing feminism still, tired writing this)","How much do I feel threatened by or root for the female character rather than simply turned on. (I can feel that, but if it’s rooted partially from those two, yes) Sorry tired while writing this."
