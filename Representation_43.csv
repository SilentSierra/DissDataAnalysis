6,Man,36-41,United Kingdom,At least once a week,At least once a month,Quite important,"Yes, I have heard of it before",No,It is a very basic test and does nothing to consider whether women are portrayed in a stereotypical negative light (e.g. a woman sex worker coming to harm).,Yes,Conversation length needs to be proportionate to the overall duration of the programme.

Possibly.

'The womanly face of war' is one resource about this. Whether games should portray this in accurate ways is up for debate. I think it would be good if COD had missions where women were in realistic roles, but if someone uploaded footage to YouTube of them stabbing perfectly nice women soldiers or spies, I would be sad. Same as when the suffragist gets killed in red dead redemption.

8,Woman,24-29,Ukraine ,At least once a day,At least once a week,Very important,"Yes, I have heard of and used it before",Yes,,Yes,"The overall statistic weight of the interaction? Technically, a media will pass a test if there’s one interaction between two women drug addicts about drugging children, but it’s still a questionable message if that’s the only interaction women have ","Merlin BBC with Morgana - sure, she is evil, but her motivations are clearly defined and understandable, and she’s a decently well written as a character, but then the show has a whole of three statistically significant women. The Legend of Vox Machina - an animated series, women are portrayed in all ways, shapes, colours, alignments. Brooklyn 99 did a good job too. ","Latest Assassins Creed did decently - except they are cowards and have still not committed to having a woman protagonist, always having an option to change characters gender, so the toxic community doesn’t lash out about them being ‘woke’. Same problem with Cyberpunk 2077, but in reverse. The Last of Us 2 has amazing women characters though from what I’ve glimpsed. Technically tomb raider would fit the criteria - but the protagonist is so heavily sexualised that this technicality hurts. Hades was really good. ",Yes,,"A sense of drive, motivation, intelligence behind the choices - and the ability to make those choices. A strong female character can easily be a housewife - stereotypically weak position and all - but still be skilled in handling difficult situations, in keeping the balance, in being a moving force, if represented and written properly ","A stupid naiveness is a big no for me - a lot of ‘strong’ women characters fall into a ‘born sexy yesterday’ stereotypes and it drives me up the wall, because it’s all about a naive pretty women who live their life ‘wrong’ until a man shows up and show them what’s right ",Historical accuracy/context can never justify a lack of representation,"‘Historical context’ is a consequence of overlooking women in history, especially WW2 - the amount of women snipers?? Women sergeants?? If historical context was actually accurate, there would be women everywhere- discriminated against mostly, but still there. The AIDS crisis?? Women are everywhere, always been everywhere in history, and erasing them is not synonymous of accuracy ",Other (please clarify in Question 24 below),"In theory, yes, but I can hardly think of a good example? Tomb Raider surely isn’t, the entire video game is her backside in tight pants in front of a scenery. It is difficult to say how it can be done - even turning into a robot would not really stop the sexualisation, and it kind of didn’t, the Metroid Dread example still has extremely exaggerated female traits and accents on thighs, waist, and I’m sure there are boobs there somewhere. Actually, maybe one example of it would be Vi and Caitlyn from League of Legends and the way, way, *way* better representation of them in Arcane series. It is, however, overshadowed by a toxic community that decided to sexualise a teenager in that show instead, so you know, you win some you loose some. ","Motivations of individual characters and their role in the overall plot? Do they make a difference to the plot? Technically, the Lord of the Rings doesn’t pass the test, but Eowyn is probably one of the strongest characters in the entire trilogy, and her actions and her presence define the course of the narrative in parts. Katara from Avatar the Last Airbender is also one of the strongest characters ever probably, so is Toph, and they are central to the plot line. On the other hand, Phoebe from Friends is central in the series, but arguably strong as a character within a narrative, at least to me - besides her own story, she hardly impacts the lives for other friends, save for the time she let Rachel live at her place for a while. ","Appearance and clothing is usually key in highlighting elements about characters, and props that immediately surround them. Also things like accents, implying their origin and background. ","Again, their impact on the story - if there’s a story. A lot is down to the dialogue and random lines characters say in the meantime that are used to highlight their experiences. ","Appearance and clothing in default settings gives a good idea about how the characters are expected to be perceived- and the voice acting, though often underestimated, is incredibly influential. Roshan from (not even yet released) Assassins Creed Mirage has shook me to the core, there is a weight and gravitas and force to that voice, and from the trailer it seems to be very fitting to the leadership position she holds - I hope they don’t mess it up, honestly ","Equipment that is clearly male/female coded - we’re talking exclusively finding armoured bra’s if you’re playing a woman. The high-pitched moans of pain when hit - really messed up my Tomb Raider experience. It’s not gameplay probably though. The over the top pink abilities in League of Legends though is very gameplay choice - but then again, it’s a known toxic horrible game ","Relatability, I suppose. But also, since I prefer story-driven games, it’s always about their motivations and drive - I don’t really vibe with ‘saving the love interest’, but I’m very on board with mass murder for the greater good if she swings that way, you know.

It all depends",In video games narrative seems to be taking a back seat for exploration so it is harder to show any sort of representation except in things like side quests. In more narrative games it can be used like in movies but with the person in control empathy can be increased as their struggle was literally yours.,Character plays a stronger role as you are less likely to see growth in side character in a game over a movie so that base character you start with has to represent some group if you want it to. The main characters starting point is even more important as a good game is all about progress and growth.,Little. How a game plays does little to represent the character.,Not great but improving. I think in modern games a strong female character can be found in it but on the other hand the protagonist will rarely be (or become) said character. As mentioned above I do think horizon zero dawn does this well as it does mention how the female character has to act differently to their male counterparts. It shows her overcoming her struggles and eventually becoming great. I do think the whole prophesied one does undermine this but it does add to the story.

Amnesia Rebirth (2020) is a game where you play as a woman who is essentially stranded on her own and in that sense the story revolves around her alone, without the help of anyone else.  She acts believably and relatably and her identity as a woman is directly acknowledged within the story - her womanhood is essential to her as a character.  Milk Inside A Bag of Milk... & its sequel Milk Outside a Bag of Milk... are two indie visual novels in which the player must talk to a girl who is going to the store to buy milk.  The story tackles themes of isolation, mental illness and exclusion and is generally sad.  What it does well is portray the unnamed protagonist as a person who despite all she deals with is at heart confident in herself.  The player is given choices of how to interact with her, and her response to rude behaviour, while sometimes self depricating often turns into her setting boundaries with the player and standing her ground.  She is written relatably and contrary to a number of other visual novels is not sexualised in any way as to appeal to the player - she exists for herself and the game is written in a way that the player could believe that she exists entirely independently from them.",Yes,"Strength can come in many forms for anyone, it can be physical strength or it can be resolve and determination.

If the player is able to play as a woman, and how that affects the experience.  In most cases, being able to to play as a woman only means a change of pronouns in dialogue, but perhaps in the future, the choice of gender could have a meaningful impact on how the player interacts with the world.  (I have heard only anecdotaly about a character in Cyberpunk 2077 who is a lesbian who will only show interest in the player if they chose to play as a woman.)",I would assess it by asking Can I play as a woman?

She displays intellectual prowess in both her school work and during key plot moments, both are quite developed and very well written, strong characters, who i believe break the typical female mold some media likes to portray.

If your WW2 film is aiming to be a real representation of the front lines, where almost no women were; then the representation of women doesn't seem entirely relevant here.

Steven Moffat's Doctor Who, Dracula, Jekyll & Sherlock is a good example of poorly represented female characters despite things looking promising at first glance.  His narratives only need 3 types of woman: pathetic, in love with the main male character (even if she's a lesbian??), or very openly a dominatrix (but has a soft ""weak"" side, again, for the main male character only). ","It's hard for me to break this stuff down into components (sorry), especially because we'd be here forever because I believe the entire thing plays a part in this - representation is part of a huge tangled web we call a work of art; be it a movie or video game. ",Same answer as above," Again I believe every component and am struggling to compartmentalize everything, but gameplay gets overlooked often as a building block for a work of art! Often female characters will be weaker with less useful attacks, or just healers (which isn't bad in a vaccum, but it's certainly a pattern). Xenoblade Chronicles 3 comes to mind as a good example of representation through gameplay, as a male and female character in the main party represent each vague class (combat, tank, support). However Sena is a tank but she's built like a twig haha - all 3 girls are quite small and skinny. It can be explained away with magic, but that feels like a weak idea. I feel their bodies could have been more diverse but that's less to do with gameplay. The game overall is wonderfully diverse. "," I consume the media, check out what these characters do and how they act, and when it's poor representation, it's poor representation. I dont look out for anything in particular - usually when the writing is sexist, even when it's hidden under several layers of girlbossery, you can spot it."

E.g. do the plot and dialogue suggest that they are people with their own lives and interests, even if they're only in one small scene?","In particular, the aspects of character design that determine to what degree a character is reduced to a trope or stereotype. ","Where there's an actual story in a more or less traditional sense, e.g. in a jrpg, much of the above applies.  ","This one's interesting, because with video games, some work on the basis that the player is inhabiting the main character, so they sort of write themselves into the story. This becomes frustrating when the character design options in the visual sense don't meet one's hopes/expectations or when the dialogue choices feel out of character, which then can sort of take the player out of the game emotionally and make it less immersive. In other games, you're not so much being yourself as inhabiting an essentially complete package and trying to steer them in the right direction in order to get the outcome the designers intended. The degree of player choice/illusion of control can be a spectrum, e.g. Minecraft to Animal Crossing to BOTW to NES Super Mario Bros. So what I'm saying is that choice, or the intended perception thereof, is important because the designer has to decide what degree of control they are retaining over representation. If player-focused, then they have to decide what resources to put into designing in a lot of choices for self-representation. If the character is determined by the designer, they have to keep in mind that the player is along for the ride and take full responsibility for representation.","I think options and opportunities are quite important, i.e. can characters do and possess stuff on the basis of aspects other than stereotyped interests or roles, e.g. is it just the girls getting the dumbass lingerie armour ","If there are sex/gender-related tropes, I like them to be clearly self-aware and ideally ironic. If it's a game with a proper story and a female character can be easily summed up as ""oh that's the mouthy/girly/sexy/bookish/whatever"" one, it feels like we need to make more progress. Whether I enjoy it anyway or find it irritating typically comes down to whether there are additional aspects to the character that make them feel like a more complete person and not just e.g. an identikit *dere."
